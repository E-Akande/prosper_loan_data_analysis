# Prosper Loan Data Analysis
Often times, people seek loans from "credit providing entities" without paying back. This often causes set backs for such entities as they mostly rely on completed loan payments to stay afloat. Question is, how does a loan providing entity gauge borrowers intent or loan outcomes?

This data set, from Prosper Loans, contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

This project has two parts:

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore the dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings was through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## What did I need to install?

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It came highly recommended that I use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries were used in this project:

> NumPy
>
> Pandas
> 
> Matplotlib
> 
> Seaborn

## Why this project?

The motive of this project was, to use real data from a real life scenario to gauge borrowers' intent and loan outcomes.
